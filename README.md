# Single-Cell RNA-Seq Doublet Detection Benchmarking

This repository contains R scripts for benchmarking doublet detection methods in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Below is a detailed description of each script and its purpose.


### üìú Script Descriptions

#### 1. `02_pretreat.R`
- **Purpose**: Preprocess raw scRNA-seq data for downstream analysis.
- **Steps**:
  - Load raw data (`.rds` format) and extract the count matrix.
  - Create a Seurat object, perform normalization (`LogNormalize`), and scale data.
  - Identify highly variable features and run PCA (20 principal components).
  - Save processed data to `./02_data/03_processed_data/` and log processing metrics (time, cell/gene counts).

#### 2. `03_benchmark_real.R`
- **Purpose**: Evaluate doublet detection methods on real datasets (PBMC and HM-12k).
- **Methods**:
  - **scds**: Compute `cxds`, `bcds`, and `hybrid` doublet scores.
  - **Scrublet** (Python): Predict doublets using thresholds.
  - **DoubletFinder**: Optimize `pK` parameters for doublet detection.
- **Metrics**: Calculate precision, recall, and true negative rate (TNR) at 10%, 20%, and 40% detection rates.

#### 3. `04_benchmark_visualize.R`
- **Purpose**: Generate visualizations for benchmarking results.
- **Plots**:
  - **Grouped bar plots**: Compare precision across methods for PBMC and HM-12k datasets.
  - **Faceted line plots**: Show performance trends across simulated doublet rates.
  - **Composite bar plots**: Summarize precision, recall, and TNR from DE analysis.

#### 4. `05_ratesim.R`
- **Purpose**: Simulate datasets with varying doublet rates (2%, 4%, 8%, 10%, 20%, 40%) and evaluate method performance.
- **Workflow**:
  - Load pre-generated simulated data (`sim_rate.rds`).
  - Compute doublet scores using `scds`.
  - Calculate precision, recall, and TNR at different detection rates. Results are saved to `sim_rate2.csv`.

#### 5. `06_DE.R`
- **Purpose**: Assess the impact of doublet removal on differential expression (DE) analysis.
- **Steps**:
  - Load simulated data with ground-truth DE genes.
  - Detect doublets using `scds`, remove predicted doublets, and re-perform DE analysis (Wilcoxon test).
  - Calculate precision, recall, and TNR to quantify improvements in DE results.
